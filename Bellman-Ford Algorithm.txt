/** Since the Edges are E are getting relaxed V-1 times, its time complexity is given by Big-oh O(E * V).
 In the case of V = E, the time complexity would be O(n^2).
 
 Also, if it were a complete graph where each node is connected to every other node, then the value of E would be:-
    E = V * (V-1) / 2
 
 This multiplied by V - 1 would be:-
 
 V * (V-1) * (V - 1) / 2
 
 would give us a time complexity of O(n^3).
 
 Therefore, in the case of a complete graph; Bellman-Ford would take cubic amount of time as compared to quadratic time.
